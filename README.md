Genetic algorithms are a population-based Meta heuristics. They have been successfully applied to many optimization problems. Methods were tested and various experimental results show that memetic algorithm performs better than the genetic algorithms for such type of NP-Hard combinatorial problem.

The ability of directing the random search process of the genetic algorithm by selecting the fittest chromosomes among the population is the main characteristic of the algorithm. So the fitness function is the main factor of the algorithm. The choice of fitness measure depends entirely on the language characteristics must be known.
